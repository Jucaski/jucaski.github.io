You can run Python's interpreter in a terminal.

The three angle brackets prompt, called Python prompt, indicates you are using the terminal window.

```python 
# Suspended the terminal session
ctrl + Z
# if you want to end the session 
ctl + D
# or just simply type 
exit()
```

The *f* after the parenthesis and before the string do the formatting in the string:
```python
welcome = "Hello World!"
print(f"{welcome}")
```
